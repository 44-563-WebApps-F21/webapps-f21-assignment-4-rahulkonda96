        <h2>_Room in the Duke’s Palace_</h2>
        <h3>_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
            the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
            of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
            canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
            the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
            the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
            gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
            _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
            into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
            cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
            very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
            enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.</h3>

            <h4 class="name secondcitizen">SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
            <p class="speech">Alack, your Grace, the taxes which the customs<br>
            Take at the city gate are grown so high<br>
            We cannot buy wine<br></p>
            <h4 class="name duke">DUKE</h4>
            <p class="speech">Then you should bless the taxes<br>
            Which make you temperate.<br></p>
            <h4 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h4>
            <p class="speech">Think, while we sit<br>
            In gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty<br>
            Creeps through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives<br>
            Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily<br>
            And no word said.<br>
            <h4 class="name thirdcitizen">THIRD CITIZEN</h4>
            <p class="speech">Ay! marry, that is true,<br>
            My little son died yesternight from hunger;<br>
            He was but six years old; I am so poor,<br>
            I cannot bury him.<br></p>
            <h4 class="name duke">DUKE</h4>
            <p class="speech">If you are poor,<br>
            Are you not blessed in that?  Why, poverty<br>
            Is one of the Christian virtues,<br></p>
                                                         <p class="stage-direction">[_Turns to the_ CARDINAL.]<br></p>
            <p class="speech">Is it not?<br>
            I know, Lord Cardinal, you have great revenues,<br>
            Rich abbey-lands, and tithes, and large estates<br>
            For preaching voluntary poverty.<br></p>
            <h4 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h4>
            <p class="speech">Nay but, my lord the Duke, be generous;<br>
            While we sit here within a noble house<br>
            [With shaded porticoes against the sun,<br>
            And walls and roofs to keep the winter out],<br>
            There are many citizens of Padua<br>
            Who in vile tenements live so full of holes,<br>
            That the chill rain, the snow, and the rude blast,<br>
            Are tenants also with them; others sleep<br>
            Under the arches of the public bridges<br>
            All through the autumn nights, till the wet mist<br>
            Stiffens their limbs, and fevers come, and so—<br></p>
            <h4 class="name duke">DUKE</h4>
            <p class="speech">And so they go to Abraham’s bosom, Madam.<br>
            They should thank me for sending them to Heaven<br>
            If they are wretched here. [_To the_ CARDINAL.]<br>
            Is it not said<br>
            Somewhere in Holy Writ, that every man<br>
            Should be contented with that state of life<br>
            God calls him to?  Why should I change their state,<br>
            Or meddle with an all-wise providence,<br>
            Which has apportioned that some men should starve,<br>
            And others surfeit?  I did not make the world.<br></p>
            <h4 class="name firstcitizen">FIRST CITIZEN</h4>
            <p class="speech">He hath a hard heart.<br></p>
            <h4 class="name secondcitizen">SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
            <p class="speech">Nay, be silent, neighbour;<br>
            I think the Cardinal will speak for us.<br></p>
            <h4 class="name cardinal">CARDINAL</h4>
            <p class="speech">True, it is Christian to bear misery,<br>
            Yet it is Christian also to be kind,<br>
            And there seem many evils in this town,<br>
            Which in your wisdom might your Grace reform.<br></p>
            <h4 class="name firstcitizen">FIRST CITIZEN</h4>
            <p class="speech">What is that word reform?  What does it mean?<br></p>
            <h4 class="name secondcitizen">SECOND CITIZEN</h4>
            <p class="speech">Marry, it means leaving things as they are; I like it not.<br></p>

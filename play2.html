        <h2>_Room in the Duke’s Palace_</h2>
        <h3>_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
            the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
            of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
            canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
            the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
            the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
            gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
            _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
            into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
            cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
            very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
            enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.</h3>

            <p class="speech">Alack, your Grace, the taxes which the customs<br>
            Take at the city gate are grown so high<br>
            We cannot buy wine<br></p>
            <h4 class="name duke">DUKE</h4>
            <p class="speech">Then you should bless the taxes<br>
            Which make you temperate.<br></p>
            <h4 class="name duchess">DUCHESS</h4>
            <p class="speech">Think, while we sit<br>
            In gorgeous pomp and state, gaunt poverty<br>
            Creeps through their sunless lanes, and with sharp knives<br>
            Cuts the warm throats of children stealthily<br>
            And no word said.<br>

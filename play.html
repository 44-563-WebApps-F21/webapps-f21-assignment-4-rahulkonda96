        <h2>_Room in the Duke’s Palace_</h2>
        <h3>_A state room in the Ducal Palace_, _hung with tapestries representing
            the Masque of Venus_; _a large door in the centre opens into a corridor
            of red marble_, _through which one can see a view of Padua_; _a large
            canopy is set_ (_R.C._) _with three thrones_, _one a little lower than
            the others_; _the ceiling is made of long gilded beams_; _furniture of
            the period_, _chairs covered with gilt leather_, _and buffets set with
            gold and silver plate_, _and chests painted with mythological scenes_.
            _A number of the courtiers is out on the corridor looking from it down
            into the street below_; _from the street comes the roar of a mob and
            cries of_ ‘_Death to the Duke_’: _after a little interval enter the Duke
            very calmly_; _he is leaning on the arm of Guido Ferranti_; _with him
            enters also the Lord Cardinal_; _the mob still shouting_.</h3>

            <h4>DUKE</h2>
                <p>No, my Lord Cardinal, I weary of her!<br>
                Why, she is worse than ugly, she is good.<br></p>
            <h4>MAFFIO</h4><p>[_excitedly_]</p>
                <p>Your Grace, there are two thousand people there<br>
                Who every moment grow more clamorous.<br></p>
            <h4>DUKE</h2>
                <p>Tut, man, they waste their strength upon their lungs!<br>
                People who shout so loud, my lords, do nothing;<br>
                The only men I fear are silent men.<br></p>
                                               <p>[_A yell from the people_.]<br></p>
                <p>You see, Lord Cardinal, how my people love me.<br></p>
                                                         <p>[_Another yell_.]<br></p>
                <p>Go, Petrucci,<br>
                And tell the captain of the guard below<br>
                To clear the square.  Do you not hear me, sir?<br>
                Do what I bid you.<br></p>
                                                        <p>[_Exit_ PETRUCCI.]<br></p>
            <h4>CARDINAL</h4>
                <p>I beseech your Grace<br>
                To listen to their grievances.<br></p>
            <h4>DUKE</h4><p>[_sitting on his throne_]</p>
                <p>Ay! the peaches<br>
                Are not so big this year as they were last.<br>
                I crave your pardon, my lord Cardinal,<br>
                I thought you spake of peaches.<br></p>
                                              <p>[_A cheer from the people_.]<br></p>
                <p>What is that?</p>
            <h4>GUIDO</h4><p>[_rushes to the window_]</p>
                <p>The Duchess has gone forth into the square,<br>
                And stands between the people and the guard,<br>
                And will not let them shoot.<br></p>
            <h4>DUKE</h4>
                <p>The devil take her!</p>
            <h4>GUIDO</h4><p>[_still at the window_]</p>
                <p>And followed by a dozen of the citizens<br>
                Has come into the Palace.</p>
            <h4>DUKE</h4><p>[_starting up_]</p>
                <p>By Saint James,<br>
                Our Duchess waxes bold!<br></p>
            <h4>BARDI</h4>
                <p>Here comes the Duchess.</p>
            <h4>DUKE</h4>
                <p>Shut that door there; this morning air is cold.</p>
                                  <p>[_They close the door on the corridor_.]</p>
                <p>[_Enter the Duchess followed by a crowd of meanly dressed Citizens_.]</p>
            <h4>DUCHESS</h4><p>[_flinging herself upon her knees_]</p>
                <p>I do beseech your Grace to give us audience.</p>
            <h4>DUKE</h4>
                <p>What are these grievances?</p>
            <h4>DUCHESS</h4>
                <p>Alas, my Lord,<br>
                Such common things as neither you nor I,<br>
                Nor any of these noble gentlemen,<br>
                Have ever need at all to think about;<br>
                They say the bread, the very bread they eat,<br>
                Is made of sorry chaff.<br></p>
            <h4>FIRST CITIZEN</h4>
                <p>Ay! so it is,<br>
                Nothing but chaff.<br></p>
            <h4>DUKE</h4>
                <p>And very good food too,<br>
                I give it to my horses.<br></p>
            <h4>DUCHESS</h4><p>[_restraining herself_]</p>
                <p>They say the water,<br>
                Set in the public cisterns for their use,<br>
                [Has, through the breaking of the aqueduct,]<br>
                To stagnant pools and muddy puddles turned.<br></p>
            <h4>DUKE</h4>
            <p>They should drink wine; water is quite unwholesome.</p>
